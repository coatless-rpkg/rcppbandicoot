## Overview

[Bandicoot](https://coot.sourceforge.io/) is a C++ header-only GPU accelerated
linear algebra library written by developers behind [Armadillo](https://arma.sourceforge.io/) that provides high-level syntax for performing computations on
graphics processing units.

The RcppBandicoot package includes the header files from the Bandicoot library
and integrates a seamless experience with R by using the 
[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) package. 
Therefore, users do not need to install Bandicoot to use RcppBandicoot. 

## Status

The package is under active development with releases to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
about once a month.
