Description: 'Bandicoot' is a templated C++ GPU Linear Algebra library 
 (by the 'Armadillo' team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing 
 high performant code for graphics processing units.
 The 'RcppBandicoot' package includes the header files from the 'Bandicoot' library.
 Therefore, users do not need to install 'Bandicoot' to use 'RcppBandicoot'.
 Note that the 'Bandicoot' library is licensed under Apache License version 2.0 and
 'RcppBandicoot' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Bandicoot') is licensed under 
 the GNU GPL version 2 or later. Note that 'Bandicoot' requires a compiler that 
 supports 'C++11' and 'OpenCL' or 'CUDA' 9.800 or later.
