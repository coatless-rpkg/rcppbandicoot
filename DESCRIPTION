Description: 'Bandicoot' is a templated C++ GPU Linear Algebra library
 (by the 'Armadillo' team) that provides a simple set of abstractions for writing
 high performant code for graphics processing units.
 The 'RcppBandicoot' package includes the header files from the 'Bandicoot' library.
 Therefore, users do not need to install 'Bandicoot' to use 'RcppBandicoot'.
 Note that the 'Bandicoot' library is licensed under Apache License version 2.0 and
 'RcppBandicoot' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Bandicoot') is licensed under
 the GNU GPL version 2 or later. Note that 'Bandicoot' requires a compiler that
 supports 'OpenCL' (>= 1.2) or 'CUDA' (>= 9.8).
