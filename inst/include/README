Procedure for updating the Bandicoot library:

- Download Bandicoot from upstream
- Copy and replace the bandicoot.hpp and bandicoot_bits found in this directory

RcppBandicoot Integration Headers:

The following headers provide seamless integration between R and Bandicoot GPU matrices:

- RcppBandicoot.h: Main header file to include in your C++ code
- RcppBandicootForward.h: Forward declarations for Rcpp/Bandicoot integration
- RcppBandicootWrap.h: Implements wrap() functions to convert Bandicoot types to R objects
- RcppBandicootAs.h: Implements as() functions to convert R objects to Bandicoot types

These headers enable automatic conversion between R matrices/vectors and Bandicoot GPU matrices,
allowing you to write C++ functions that seamlessly accept R data and return GPU-computed results.
